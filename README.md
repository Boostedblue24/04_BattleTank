Open world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain and advanced control systems in UE4

## Battletank GDD

This game, built with the help of Ben Tristrem's Unreal Course video series, is an exercise in exciting small-scale, high intensity tank warfare. 
set on a hand-crafted battlefield, Battletank pits one or two players against an enemy AI in a tank battle with sharp, tuned controls, nimble tanks 
and intense survival mechanics. 

Players only have a limited number of shots and and even smaller health pool, so they will need to use their wits, and the terrain itself to outwit
the AI and win the game by defeating all enemies.
